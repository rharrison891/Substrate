# Substrate

## A generator suite for .Net. 
Substrate is the answer to the question

> **"Why is WPF so complicated?"**

WPF itself is an incredibly powerful platform that offers developers a real way to express themselves. A highly developed environment where almost everything can be customised. 

- Chrome windows
- Custom controls
- Templating
- Animation
- Effects

The problems start when you actually try to implement any of these. The amount of standardised coding required to make these work stops most of us ever actually using WPF to it's full potential.

MVVM has developed as its own ecosystem to help take some of the pain away, and other generator packages have simplified that for us. But that is a small piece of the problem. We still have

- Dependency properties
- Xaml themes
- Validation 
- Confusing font systems

## Why Substrate?
Substrate exists to remove that pain - making these tasks simple, predictable, and fast. Our aim is for no unnecessary boilerplate needed...Ever.

- Reduces boilerplate to almost nothing
- Automates repetitive UI tasks
- Keeps code clean and maintainable

If you constantly find yourself writing the same code over and over, let us know. If it's repetitive, it's reproducible - and Substrate will automate it.
